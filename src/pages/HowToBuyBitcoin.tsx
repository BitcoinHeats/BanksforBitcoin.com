    q: "How much Bitcoin should I buy to start?",

    q: "Do I have to buy a whole Bitcoin?",
    a: "No. Bitcoin is divisible into 100 million smaller units called 'satoshis' (or 'sats'). You can buy any amount, even $5 worth. One Bitcoin is currently worth tens of thousands of dollars, but you can own a fraction.",
  },
  {
    q: "What are the fees?",
    a: "Fees vary by app. Some charge a percentage per purchase (often 1–2%), others charge a spread on the price. Lightning Network payments can be nearly free. Always check the fee shown before confirming a purchase.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is it safe?",
    a: "Bitcoin itself is very secure, but the risk is in how you store it. Leaving Bitcoin on an app means you trust that company. Moving it to your own wallet (self-custody) and protecting your recovery phrase is the safest approach, but it means the responsibility is yours.",
  },
  {
    q: "What if I lose my phone or the app shuts down?",
    a: "If your Bitcoin is on an app and the app disappears, you could lose access. This is why self-custody matters. With your own wallet, your recovery phrase lets you restore your funds on any compatible wallet, anywhere.",
